The goal was to solidify both programming and networking skills by recreating a YouTube-like platform with real-time features. The system integrates a Django backend for core APIs, a React.js frontend for the interface, and a simulated CDN server built with Node.js and Next.js. Real-time asynchronous communication was implemented using Node.js, while TailwindCSS and HTML handled styling and layouts. In addition, I wrote Python tests to ensure reliability and maintainability. This experience not only strengthened my backend and frontend development skills but also deepened my understanding of networking concepts such as socket programming and distributed systems.","tech":["React.js","Next.js","Django","Node.js","TailwindCSS","HTML","Python (Testing)"],"images":["/images/projects/youtube01.jpeg","/images/projects/youtube-2.png"],"github":"https://github.com/Polymath-Kaila/Youtube-clone","demo":""},{"id":"clinicx","title":"ClinicX","tagline":"Robust API-driven clinic management system","description":"ClinicX is a backend-only healthcare management system built with Django, designed to support the day-to-day operations of modern clinics. It provides a secure and scalable set of APIs that allow multiple stakeholders to interact: patients can manage appointments and access their medical history, doctors can oversee consultations, update patient records, and prescribe treatments, while suppliers handle inventory and delivery workflows. The system enforces strict role-based access control, ensuring data privacy and compliance with healthcare standards. This project strengthened my expertise in designing RESTful APIs, implementing authentication/authorization, and building reliable backend architectures for real-world use cases.","tech":["Django","Django REST Framework (DRF)","PostgreSQL","JWT Authentication","Role-Based Access Control","Automated Testing"],"images":["/images/projects/clinicx01.jpeg","/images/projects/clinicx-2.png"],"github":"https://github.com/Polymath-Kaila/clinicx","demo":""},{"id":"mentor-tracker","title":"Mentor Tracker","tagline":"Track mentorship sessions, goals, and outcomes.","description":"Lightweight tool used during teaching to record topics, attendees, and outcomes.","tech":["Next.js","Local JSON","TailwindCSS"],"images":["/images/projects/mentor-1.png"],"github":"https://github.com/Polymath-Kaila/clinicx"}]');
