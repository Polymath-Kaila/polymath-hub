The goal was to solidify both programming and networking skills by recreating a YouTube-like platform with real-time features. The system integrates a Django backend for core APIs, a React.js frontend for the interface, and a simulated CDN server built with Node.js and Next.js. Real-time asynchronous communication was implemented using Node.js, while TailwindCSS and HTML handled styling and layouts. In addition, I wrote Python tests to ensure reliability and maintainability. This experience not only strengthened my backend and frontend development skills but also deepened my understanding of networking concepts such as socket programming and distributed systems.","tech":["React.js","Next.js","Django","Node.js","TailwindCSS","HTML","Python (Testing)"],"images":["/images/projects/youtube01.jpeg","/images/projects/youtube-2.png"],"github":"https://github.com/Polymath-Kaila/Youtube-clone","demo":""},{"id":"bank-api","title":"Bank API","tagline":"Secure RESTful API for banking operations.","description":"JWT auth, transactions, statements, role-based access.
